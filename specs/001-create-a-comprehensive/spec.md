## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- **Q: What is the complete order status workflow?** ‚Üí **A: Primary Flow: New ‚Üí Reviewing ‚Üí [Rejected (END) OR Reviewed] ‚Üí Quoted ‚Üí [Declined (END) OR Accepted OR Expired (END)] ‚Üí [Paid OR PO Issued] ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Finished ‚Üí Shipped. Exception Flows: In Progress ‚Üî On Hold (pause/resume), Finished/Shipped ‚Üí Reopen ‚Üí In Progress (rework), Paid ‚Üí Cancelled (END). Terminal states: Rejected, Declined, Expired, Cancelled, Shipped (unless Reopen). PO Issued added for B2B business term payments.**
- **Q: What is the access control model for order permissions?** ‚Üí **A: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with four roles: Customer (own orders only), Employee (assigned orders), Manager (department orders), Admin (all orders). Confidential orders require appropriate role authorization.**
- **Q: How should the system authenticate users?** ‚Üí **A: Integrate with existing MALIEV Auth Service for single sign-on across all MALIEV microservices. JWT-based authentication.**
- **Q: What file formats and size limits should be supported for order uploads?** ‚Üí **A: All common formats supported - CAD files (STL, STEP, IGES, OBJ, etc.), images (JPG, PNG, PDF), documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX), archives (ZIP, RAR). Max 100MB per file, 500MB total per order.**
- **Q: How should the system integrate with Shopify for order imports?** ‚Üí **A: OUT OF SCOPE - Shopify product sales (injection molding machines, materials, tools) handled by separate E-commerce/Inventory Service. Order Service focuses exclusively on custom manufacturing/service orders created via Order Service API.**
- **Q: Should status update notes be visible to customers or internal only?** ‚Üí **A: Separate notes - Internal notes (employee-only visibility) and Customer-facing notes (visible to customers). Employees can add both types when updating status.**
- **Q: Should non-NDA customers be able to request confidential treatment for specific orders?** ‚Üí **A: No - only customers with signed NDAs can have confidential orders. Confidentiality is automatic for NDA customers, not available as manual option for non-NDA customers.**
- **Q: Where should customer NDA status and agreement details come from?** ‚Üí **A: Separate Customer Service - NDA data managed in dedicated customer/CRM microservice. Order Service queries NDA status via API when creating orders.**
- **Q: What batch operations should employees be able to perform on orders?** ‚Üí **A: Full CRUD batch operations - create multiple orders, update multiple orders, delete multiple orders, bulk assignment to employees/departments, bulk status changes.**
- **Q: What are the notification requirements for order status changes?** ‚Üí **A: Real-time interface-based notifications - Order Service defines notification interface, implementation deferred for later. Subscription-based multi-channel delivery (LINE chat, email, etc.) for customers who opt-in.**
- **Q: How should payment status be tracked?** ‚Üí **A: External payment service - Payment handled entirely by external payment/billing service. Order Service only references payment ID, does not track payment status internally.**
- **Q: What is the data retention period for orders and files?** ‚Üí **A: Standard compliance - 7 years for order data (tax/audit compliance), 30 days post-completion for files, then automatic deletion.**
- **Q: What should happen when Customer Service API is unavailable during order creation?** ‚Üí **A: Block creation - Reject order creation until API is available, return error to user. Ensures NDA status accuracy, no orders created with unknown confidentiality.**
- **Q: What should happen when a batch operation partially fails?** ‚Üí **A: All-or-nothing rollback - If any operation in the batch fails, rollback all changes and return error with details of failed items. Ensures data consistency.**
- **Q: What concurrency control strategy should be used for order updates?** ‚Üí **A: Optimistic locking - Use version numbers/timestamps to detect conflicts. Allow concurrent updates, detect conflicts on commit, return error if version mismatch.**
- **Q: What is the file upload retry mechanism?** ‚Üí **A: Automatic retry - System automatically retries failed uploads up to 3 times with exponential backoff before reporting error to user.**
- **Q: What is the cancellation policy for orders after production has started?** ‚Üí **A: Allow cancellation with partial charges - Orders can be cancelled even after In Progress. Full refund for work not completed, charge for materials and labor already used.**
- **Q: What are the Payment/Billing Service endpoints and what payment data should Order Service store?** ‚Üí **A: Payment Service endpoints: GET https://api.maliev.com/payments/v1/{paymentId} (get payment status), POST https://api.maliev.com/payments/v1/payments (create payment record), POST https://api.maliev.com/payments/v1/refunds (process refunds/partial charges). Order Service stores only: payment status (paid/not paid) and paymentId reference for querying Payment Service.**
- **Q: What are the Notification Service endpoints and payload format?** ‚Üí **A: Notification Service endpoints: POST https://api.maliev.com/notifications/v1/send (send notification, auto-handles multi-channel delivery including LINE, email), GET https://api.maliev.com/notifications/v1/{notificationId}/status (get notification status). Payload format not fully specified yet - implement starting interface for order update notifications only.**
- **Q: What are the MALIEV Auth Service endpoints and what is the best approach for RBAC with dual databases (Customer DB and Employee DB)?** ‚Üí **A: Auth Service endpoint: POST https://api.maliev.com/auth/v1/validate (validate access token in request header). Recommended RBAC approach: Context-based authorization where Auth Service validates token and returns user context (userType: customer/employee, userId, roles). Order Service implements business logic based on user type. Customers create orders from their account page. Employees create and manage all orders.**
- **Q: What are the Employee Service endpoints?** ‚Üí **A: Employee Service endpoints: GET https://api.maliev.com/employees/v1/{employeeId} (get employee details), GET https://api.maliev.com/employees/v1/departments/{departmentId} (list employees by department).**
- **Q: What are the File Upload Service endpoints and how should file storage be managed?** ‚Üí **A: File Upload Service endpoints: POST https://api.maliev.com/uploads/v1/files (upload file to GCS bucket using FileUploadRequest model with IFormFile, ObjectPath like "orders/{orderId}/files/drawing.pdf", AccessLevel, ServiceMetadata), GET https://api.maliev.com/uploads/v1/files/path?objectPath={objectPath} (download file), DELETE https://api.maliev.com/uploads/v1/files/path?objectPath={objectPath} (delete file). Upload Service handles actual GCS bucket operations.**
- **Q: What are the Material Service endpoints and how should material/color/surface finishing selections be managed?** ‚Üí **A: Material Service endpoints: GET /materials/v1/materials?serviceCategoryId={id} (list materials for service type), GET /materials/v1/materials/{materialId}/colors (available colors for material), GET /materials/v1/materials/{materialId}/surface-finishings?colorId={id} (available finishings for material/color). Order Service stores integer references (materialId, colorId, surfaceFinishingId) and validates via Material Service. Material Service enforces constraints (e.g., certain colors only available for specific materials). Order Service does NOT calculate costs - only stores quote amount from Quoting Service.**
- **Q: How should order notes be managed and what's the difference from status notes?** ‚Üí **A: Two note systems: (1) Status-specific notes: tied to status changes (OrderStatus.internal_notes, OrderStatus.customer_notes), (2) General order notes: separate table (order_notes) with full history tracking - customer notes (visible to all) and internal notes (employees only). Employees can add internal notes for coordination ("VIP customer", "material delayed"). Customers can add notes about requirements. Each note records: noteType, noteText, createdBy, createdAt.**

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A customer visits MALIEV's website to place an order for custom manufacturing services (e.g., 3D printing, CNC machining). They create an order specifying the service type, upload necessary design files, and optionally mark the order as confidential under NDA. Throughout the manufacturing process, the customer can track the order status in real-time. Meanwhile, MALIEV employees receive the order, assign it to appropriate technicians, update its progress through various stages (received, in-production, quality-check, completed, shipped), and communicate updates back to the customer.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a customer wants to order a 3D printing service, **When** they create a new order with service type "3D Printing - FDM" and upload STL files, **Then** the system must accept the order, generate a unique order ID, and set the initial status to "Received"

2. **Given** an employee needs to update an order's progress, **When** they change the status from "Received" to "In Production" and add notes, **Then** the system must persist the status change with timestamp and employee information

3. **Given** a customer has placed a confidential order, **When** they mark the order as NDA-protected, **Then** the system must restrict access to authorized personnel only and display confidentiality indicators

4. **Given** a customer wants to check their order progress, **When** they retrieve the order by order ID, **Then** the system must display current status, timestamps, uploaded files, and status history

5. **Given** an order requires multiple file uploads, **When** the customer or employee uploads design files, specifications, or reference images, **Then** the system must associate these files with the order and track file metadata

6. **Given** the business offers diverse service categories, **When** creating an order, **Then** the system must allow selection from predefined service categories (3D Printing, 3D Scanning, CNC Machining, etc.) with specific process types

7. **Given** a customer has a signed NDA agreement on file, **When** they create any new order, **Then** the system must automatically mark the order as confidential without requiring manual selection

8. **Given** an employee updates an order status, **When** they add both an internal note ("Waiting for material supplier") and a customer-facing note ("Order processing is on track"), **Then** the system must store both notes separately, showing only the customer-facing note to the customer while displaying both to employees

9. **Given** a manager needs to assign multiple orders to their team, **When** they select 20 orders and bulk assign them to 3 different employees, **Then** the system must update all order assignments in a single operation and record the assignment change for each order

10. **Given** a customer has subscribed to LINE chat and email notifications, **When** their order status changes from "In Progress" to "Finished", **Then** the system must trigger a notification event to be delivered via both LINE chat and email channels

11. **Given** an order is currently "In Progress" with 40% work completed, **When** a customer cancels the order, **Then** the system must calculate partial charges for materials and labor used, process refund for remaining 60%, and transition order to Cancelled terminal state

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a customer tries to access another customer's confidential order? System enforces RBAC - Customer role can only access own orders, request denied with 403 Forbidden.
- How does the system handle file upload failures or incomplete uploads? System validates file size (max 100MB per file, 500MB total per order) and format before upload. Failed uploads automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff. If all retries fail, return error to user.
- What happens when an order is cancelled after production has started? System allows cancellation at any stage. Calculates partial charges for materials and labor already used. Full refund issued for work not completed. Transition to Cancelled terminal state.
- What happens when Customer Service API is unavailable during order creation? System rejects order creation and returns error to user (503 Service Unavailable). No orders created without NDA status verification to ensure confidentiality accuracy.
- What happens when Material Service API is unavailable during order creation? System rejects orders that require material validation. Orders without material selections (consulting, design services) can proceed.
- What happens when a batch operation partially fails (e.g., 8 of 10 orders updated successfully, 2 failed)? System uses all-or-nothing transaction strategy - rollback all changes if any operation fails, return error with details of failed items. Ensures data consistency.
- What happens when multiple employees try to update the same order simultaneously? System uses optimistic locking with version numbers. First update succeeds. Subsequent updates on stale version return 409 Conflict error, requiring user to refresh and retry.
- How long are order files retained after order completion? Files are automatically deleted 30 days after order reaches terminal state (Shipped, Cancelled, Rejected, Declined, Expired). Order metadata (including notes) retained for 7 years for compliance.
- What happens when a customer tries to view internal notes? System enforces access control - customers can only view customer-type notes, internal notes filtered out from API responses.
- How does the system handle orders without files? Files are optional at creation. Consulting services, design orders (starting with verbal requirements), and scanning orders (starting with photos) may not have CAD files initially.

- **Order 3D Scanning Attributes**: Service-specific attributes for 3D scanning orders. Attributes: required_accuracy (string, e.g., "¬±0.1mm"), scan_location (text, null = in-house or customer address), output_file_formats (string, CSV list like "STL,STEP,PLY"), deviation_report_requested (boolean).

- **Order 3D Design Attributes**: Service-specific attributes for 3D design orders. Attributes: complexity_level (string: Simple/Medium/Complex), deliverables (string, CSV list), design_software (string, e.g., "SolidWorks"), revision_rounds (integer, default 2).

- **Order Status**: Represents the current state of an order in the fulfillment workflow. Status types include: New, Reviewing, Rejected, Reviewed, Quoted, Declined, Accepted, Expired, Paid, PO Issued, In Progress, On Hold, Finished, Shipped, Reopen, Cancelled. Contains status type, timestamp, employee who updated it, optional internal notes (employee-only), optional customer-facing notes (visible to customers and employees), and enforces valid state transitions per workflow rules.

- **Order File**: Represents files uploaded to an order. Attributes include:
  - **Identity**: file ID, order ID reference
  - **Classification**: file_role (Input/Output/Supporting), file_category (CAD/Drawing/Image/Document/Archive/Other)
  - **CAD-Specific**: design_units (mm/inch/cm/m, nullable - for CAD files only, one order can have files in different units)
  - **Metadata**: file reference/path, filename, upload timestamp, file size (max 100MB per file), uploader identity
  - **Constraints**: Total size per order limited to 500MB
  - **Formats**: CAD (STL, STEP, IGES, OBJ), images (JPG, PNG, PDF), documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX), archives (ZIP, RAR)

- **Order Note**: Represents general order notes separate from status-specific notes. Attributes include:
  - **Identity**: noteId (unique), orderId (reference)
  - **Content**: noteType (customer/internal), noteText
  - **Audit**: createdBy (user identifier), createdAt (timestamp)
  - **Access Control**: customer notes visible to all, internal notes visible only to employees

- **Customer**: Entity representing the person or business placing the order. NDA agreement status and details are retrieved from Customer Service API when creating orders. All orders from customers with signed NDAs are automatically marked confidential. Customers without NDAs cannot request confidential treatment. Includes notification subscription preferences for multi-channel delivery (LINE chat, email, etc.).

- **Notification Subscription**: Tracks customer opt-in preferences for receiving order status notifications via various channels (LINE chat, email, SMS, etc.).

- **Employee**: Entity representing MALIEV staff who process orders. Includes role (Employee, Manager, Admin), department assignment, and order assignment information. Role determines access scope: Employee (assigned orders), Manager (department orders), Admin (all orders).

- **Confidentiality Settings**: Tracks NDA status and authorized personnel for confidential orders.

## RBAC Architecture Recommendation

### Context-Based Authorization Pattern

Based on the dual-database architecture (Customer DB and Employee DB), the recommended approach is **Context-Based Authorization**:

**Architecture**:
1. **Single Validation Flow**: Order Service validates all requests through single Auth Service endpoint
2. **User Context Response**: Auth Service returns unified user context:
   ```json
   {
     "userType": "customer" | "employee",
     "userId": "string",
     "roles": ["string"]
   }
   ```
3. **Business Logic in Order Service**: Order Service implements authorization logic based on userType

**Benefits**:
- Auth Service abstracts dual-database complexity
- Order Service receives clear, consistent user context
- Follows microservice separation of concerns
- Single integration point reduces coupling
- Supports future user type additions

**User Flows**:
- **Customers**: Authenticate via Customer DB ‚Üí Create orders from account page ‚Üí Access own orders only
- **Employees**: Authenticate via Employee DB ‚Üí Create and manage all orders ‚Üí Access based on role:
  - Employee role: Assigned orders
  - Manager role: Department orders
  - Admin role: All orders
