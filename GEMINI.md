# Maliev.OrderService Migration to .NET 9

This document summarizes the key changes and rationale behind the migration of the `Maliev.OrderService` project to .NET 9, incorporating best practices for API development and deployment.

## Key Changes Made

*   **Target Framework Update**: All projects (`Maliev.OrderService.Api`, `Maliev.OrderService.Common`, `Maliev.OrderService.Data`, `Maliev.OrderService.Tests`) were confirmed to be targeting `net9.0`.
*   **Project Structure Refinement**: The existing multi-project structure (`Api`, `Common`, `Data`, `Tests`) was leveraged, and boilerplate files were removed.
*   **API Controller Refinement**: 
    *   Introduced **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** (`CategoryDto`, `CreateCategoryRequest`, `UpdateCategoryRequest`, etc.) for clear API contracts and robust input validation using `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`.
    *   Implemented a **Service Layer** (`IOrderServiceService`, `OrderServiceService`) to encapsulate business logic, separating concerns from the controller.
    *   Controllers now depend on the service layer interface (`IOrderServiceService`) instead of directly on the `DbContext`.
    *   Controllers use DTOs for their method signatures.
    *   Ensured all API operations are asynchronous (`async/await`).
*   **Project File (`.csproj`) Cleanup**: 
    *   Confirmed `net9.0` target framework for all projects.
    *   Added necessary NuGet packages (`AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`, `Asp.Versioning.Mvc`, `Asp.Versioning.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`, `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions`, `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger*`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory`, `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`, `Moq`, `xunit`, `xunit.runner.visualstudio`) with their latest stable versions.
*   **Configuration Management**: 
    *   `Program.cs` was re-implemented to follow the architectural blueprint of the `reference_project`, including:
        *   Correct service registration order.
        *   JWT Bearer Authentication configuration with secrets read from `IConfiguration`.
        *   API Versioning setup (`AddApiVersioning`, `AddApiExplorer`).
        *   Swagger configuration with security definitions and XML documentation.
        *   CORS policy with `*.maliev.com` origins.
        *   Exception handling for development and production environments.
        *   Middleware pipeline order (`UsePathBase`, `UseHttpsRedirection`, `UseCors`, `UseAuthentication`, `UseAuthorization`, `UseSwagger`, `UseSwaggerUI`).
    *   Local development secrets (`Jwt:Issuer`, `Jwt:Audience`, `JwtSecurityKey`, `ConnectionStrings:OrderServiceDbContext`) are configured using `dotnet user-secrets set`.
*   **Boilerplate Cleanup**: Confirmed removal of 'WeatherForecast' boilerplate code.
*   **Test Refactoring**: Old test files were removed, and new unit tests were created for `OrderServiceService` and all controllers using `Moq` and `xUnit`.

## Rationale

The migration aimed to bring `Maliev.OrderService` in line with modern .NET development standards, improve maintainability, testability, and security, and ensure consistency with other services like `Maliev.AuthService` and `Maliev.JobService`. By adopting DTOs, a service layer, externalized secret management, and refactored tests, the project is now more robust, scalable, and easier to deploy in a cloud-native environment.

## Important Considerations

*   **Secrets in Google Secret Manager**: Ensure the `JwtSecurityKey` and `ConnectionStrings-OrderServiceDbContext` secrets are correctly configured in Google Secret Manager before deployment.
*   **`SecretProviderClass`**: Verify that the `maliev-shared-secrets` `SecretProviderClass` is correctly applied to your Kubernetes cluster and configured to fetch the necessary secrets from Google Secret Manager.
*   **Local Development Secrets**: For local development, use Visual Studio's User Secrets to manage sensitive information.
*   **Build and Test**: Always run `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` after any changes to ensure project integrity.
